# Unit 7 Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors (Challenge)
**_RPS? Again?! What?!!_**

### Overview
In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

### When Should You Be an Expert with the Concepts from This Homework?
By Unit 9. Try your _absolute best_ to finish this homework.

### Setup
1. Create a GitHub repo called `RPS-Multiplayer` and clone it to your computer.
2. Create a file inside of your `RPS-Multiplayer` folder called `index.html`. This is where your page's HTML will go.
3. Don't forget to include [jQuery](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js) and [Firebase](https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/live/3.0/firebase.js).
4. Inside `RPS-Multiplayer`, create your `assets` directory.
5. Create the folders and files you typically place in `assets` -- just like you had for the prior unit's homework assignments.
